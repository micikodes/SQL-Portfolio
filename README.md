# SQL-Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Maxim Mičúch and I'm a self-taught Data Analysis learner. 
Right now, I am learning SQL using MySQL, after that I want to teach myself PowerBI so I can visualize the insights gleaned from data. After that, I want to branch out into Python.
I have some experience with web development as well, with HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. 

# Structure of the Portfolio
In the PRACTICE folder, you will find queries that answer questions posed to me by Google's Gemini. The questions are generated by the AI, however, the queries are 100% mine.
